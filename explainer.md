<h2>Background Synchronization Explained</h2>

## What's All This About?

Modern web applications with heavy client-side logic often find themselves in need of the ability to synchronize data with the server. This need is exacerbated by new [offline capabilities](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker) that enable applications to run while disconnected entirely from the server.

Consider the case of a Twitter application. Who can say when 140 characters of genius will strike? In that moment it's _clearly_ preferable for a Twitter client to provide a "send later" button in cases where sending doesn't initially succeed (e.g., while offline). Similar work-saving is natural in document editing applications and event in consumption, e.g.,Kindle applications synchronizing on furthest-read page.

The web currently lacks any ability to provide this sort of functionality in a power-efficient way. Current approaches require an application (or tab) to be running and rely on slow, battery-intensive pings.

Native application platforms do not suffer these indignities, instead providing [APIs that enable developers to collaborate with the system to ensure low power usage and background-driven processing](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setInexactRepeating(int, long, long, android.app.PendingIntent)).

We propose a new API which extends [Service Workers](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker) with a new `onsync` event. This is coupled with a new document-side API for registering (and unregistering) interest in `onsync`. Together, these APIs form the basis of a powerful new capability for rich web apps.

## Requesting A Synchronization Opportunity

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- https://tweet.example.com/index.html -->
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js");

      // Registering for sync will fail unless a viable SW is available, so wait
      // for that to happen.
      navigator.serviceWorker.whenReady().then(function(sw) {
        // Returns a Promise
        navigator.sync.register(
          "string id of sync action",
          {
            minInterval: 86400 * 1000,       // ms, default: heuristic
            repeating: true,                 // default: false
            data: '',                        // default: empty string
            description: '',                 // default: empty string
            lang: '',                        // default: document lang
            dir: ''                          // default: document dir
          }
        ).then(function() { // Success
                 // No resolved value
                 // Success, sync is now registered
               },
               function() { // Failure
                 // If no SW registration
                 // User/UA denied permission
               });
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body> ... </body>
</html>
```
* `register` registers sync events for whichever SW matches the current document, even if it's not yet active.
* `id`: The name given to the sync request.  This name is required to later unregister the request.  A new request will override an old request with the same id.
* `minInterval`: A suggestion of the minimum time between sync events.  If not provided the UA will heuristically determine an interval.  This value is a suggestion, the UA may fire before or after this point.  It is ignored for non-repeating events.
* `repeating`: If true the event will continue to fire until unregisterSync is called.  Otherwise the event is fired once at the soonest (UA-determined) time to sync.
* `data`: Any additional data that may be needed by the event.  The size of the data may be limited by the UA.
* `description`: A description string justifying the need of the sync event to be presented to the user if permissions to use background sync is required by the UA.
* `lang`:
* `dir`:

## Handling Synchronization Events

Synchronization happens from the Service Worker context via the new `sync` event. It is passed the `data` string and the id from the invoking request.

```js
// sw.js
self.onsync = function(event) {
  var data = JSON.parse(event.data);

  if (event.id === "string id of sync action") {
    if (data.whatever === 'foo') {
      // rejection is indication that the UA should try
      // later (especially when network is ok)
      event.waitUntil(doAsyncStuff());
    }
  } else {
    // Garbage collect unknown syncs (perhaps from older pages).
    navigator.sync.unregister(event.id);
  }
};
```

If a sync event fails (the event.waitUntil rejects or the browser crashes) then the UA will repeat the event in the future when the browser is next available.  The UA may apply a backoff algorithm to prevent failing events from running too frequently. 

## Platform Considerations
On mobile platforms sync events will start the UA if it is not running.  On desktop platforms sync events will only run while the browser is open.  This is in line with the Push API.  The reason for this is that mobile devices regularly close UAs due to memory constraints and the user can't reasonalby be expected to keep the UA alive, whereas on the desktop the UA can be left open for synchronization.

## Removing Sync Events
```js
navigator.sync.unregister("string id of sync action to remove");
```

Available both in window and serviceworker.

## Notes

  * Since Service Workers are a requirement for Background Synchronization, and since Service Workers are limited to HTTPS origins, sites served without encryption will always fail to register for synchronization.
  * Background Synchronization is not likely to be available to all web applications, not even all apps served over SSL. Browsers may choose to limit the set of applications which can register for synchronization based on quality signals that aren't a part of the visible API.
  * `onsync` event handlers aren't allowed to run forever. Service workers may cap the total runtime of handlers, so it pays to try to batch work and count on needing to resume from failure. Also, test.
